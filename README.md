Hello :) !

This is an app for tracking your tasks.

Feel free to copy and play around with it , it's not something fancy i'm currently learning the basic concepts of react framework, because i'm comming from angular background.

Type: npm run dev 

This commands enable the backend (db.json) and react for the full usage of app.

Have fun (: !
